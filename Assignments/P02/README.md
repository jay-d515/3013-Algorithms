## Program 2 Linear Search - Using Json and Getch  

#### Due: March 18, 2024 @ 2:00

### Description
This program uses Json and Getch to perform a linear search using a Json object that loads a dictionary of words. The program then prompts the user to enter characters and suggests search options based on the user's input. Once a single word is found that matches the word input by the user, the user will be prompted to press the enter key and the definition of the word will be printed to the console.
